# Quechimba smart contracts

This is the repository with the smart contracts for QueChimba that seeks to become in a global descentralized community to match offer and demand in tourism through an auction system.

### Pre-Requisites

- EOSIO CDT (recommended version v1.7.0)
- EOSIO (recommended version v2.0)

# Usage!

Create a copy of `default.env` in a `.env` file. Modify the variables that apply.

### Run
In order to run `nodeos` and `keosd` we created the `run.sh` script that can be executed on this way:
```sh
$ ./scripts/run.sh
```

### Build

The build is done using `eosio-cpp` from the toolchain `eosio.cdt`. Go to your shell and in the root folder run this script.

```sh
$ ./scripts/build.sh
```

This will generate the `abi` and `wasm` under the folder build.

### Init chain data
This script will create the wallet and it will export the password to a `txt` file. It will import the private keys for the dev environment which are stored in the `.env` file. Additionally, this script creates some test accounts and grant some permissions to those accounts needed to do transactions with the `LKS` token.

```sh
$ ./scripts/init-chain.sh
```

### Create seed data
The `seed.sh` script creates some seed data directly in the blockchain.
```sh
$ ./scripts/seed.sh
```

### Stop
The `stop.sh` scripts will stop nodeos and keosd. It is recommended to run this script when you finish your work.
```sh
$ ./scripts/stop.sh
```

# Actions! üßê
## Qccontract
This is the contract in charge of creation of users (agencies or bakanes) as well as it is in charge of actions to publish experiences and auctions.

### Init data
This action will create the data in the config table and the booster table.
```
cleos push action qccontract init '[]' -p eosio@active
```

### Create users
You can create a bakan running the next command:
```
cleos push action qccontract usrregister '["alice", "Alice", "Patino", "0"]' -p alice@active
```

Or also you can create travel agencies:
```
cleos push action qccontract usrregister '["agency1", "Agency1", "", "1"]' -p agency1@active
```

**Parameters**
- Username, should follow the rules for usernames in eosio.
- Name of the user
- Surname of the user
- Role (0 bakan - 1 agency)

### Create/Publish experiences
You can publish experiences using an agency account running this command from the command line:
```
cleos push action qccontract expublish '["agency1","96ad17940e347866dc7463f291132d313d6778d60f0e47fb3a369d1f0a743c9d","2020-12-27T17:03:20","15", ‚Äú5000"]' -p agency1@active
```

**Parameters**
- Agency id 
- Content data 
- Maximun date to start the auction 
- Min number of places to start the auction
- Base value price for the auction in `LKS`

**Note**: The second parameter is the hash with the content of the experience. For dev purpose you can generate a hash frmo the comand line running this command:
```openssl dgst -sha256 <#content to hash>```

### Subscribe to experiences
We have a formula to avoid experiences to have an auction, unless the engagement of that experience is enough. So that, the users should interact and subscribe to the experiences using this action:
```
cleos push action qccontract expsubscribe '["alice", "1"]' -p alice@active
```

**Parameters**
- User that will be subscribed
- Experience id

**Pre-Requisites to publish an experience**
- The start date must be within three months from now
- The user should be an agency

### Start auction
AS we mentioned before, the start auction has some restrictions unless the interactions with the experience is enough. See engagement formula.

```
cleos push action qccontract atnstart '["agency1", "0", "2020-10-28T17:01:20"]' -p agency1@active
```

**Parameters**
- Agency that will start the auction (should be the same than the experience table)
- Experience ID
- Start auction date

**Pre-Requisites to start the auction**
- Not existing auction for the same experience
- Engagement should be at least 1.
- The start date can't be greater than the max auction date. Max auction date is defined in the `exppublish` action.

## Bid

Bid is the action where the bakanes will bid using their `LKS`. From command line run this:

```
cleos push action qccontract atnbid '["alice", "50001000", "0"]' -p alice@active
```

**Parameters**
- Name of the bakan that is bidding
- Price bidded
- Auction ID

**Pre-Requisites**
- The auction must exist
- The user must have in their balance an amount greater than the price

**Rules**
- The bid must exceed the highest value
- There will be a time validation to avoid scams based on some restrictions that each time the user bid will be higher

**Note**: Under the hood the `LKS` are transferred to the issuer account and then this account refund the bidder that had the highest bid.

### Other actions
- Read only actions like `balance` and `calcengexp` to calculate the engagement of an specifi experience are added.
- Other dev action called delete to delete data is created.
- Ping action to test integrations.

# Qctoken

This contract is based on the [eosio.token](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.contracts/latest/action-reference/eosio.token/index) contract.

# Engagement formula
The engagement measures the interaction with an specific experience. For now (MVP) this calulcation takes not account the amount of people that is subscribed to the experience and a fixed percentange to determine the minimun engagement

```
engagement = ( subscribers * 100 ) / ( # min places of experience * #MIN_ENGAGEMENTE_PERCENTAGE )
```
This returns a number, if the number is greater than 1, the experience can start.
